# Visual assets

Load this reference before adding, recommending, or auditing visual elements in GitHub READMEs and other GitHub-targeted documents: technology icons, stack logos, project logos, badges, screenshots, GIFs, SVGs, architecture diagrams, demo images, theme-aware images — **and visual asset suggestions** when the agent cannot produce real assets.

This reference has three parts:

1. **Visual asset suggestions** — the suggestion system for assets the agent cannot create (screenshots, diagrams, GIFs, video previews).
2. **Adding real assets** — rules for icons, badges, logos, screenshots, diagrams, theme-aware images.
3. **Verification** — checking that every asset reference is real.

# Part 1: Visual asset suggestions

## When to run the review

Always, as the final pass of the workflow: **after** the Markdown improvement and validation passes. The improved structure may reveal visual opportunities that were not obvious before.

Ask internally, per section: "Would a visual asset make this section significantly easier to understand?"

- **No** → do nothing.
- **Yes + the asset is a banner, logo, icon set, or simple diagram** → **author a real SVG file** in the repository, verify it exists, then reference it (see "Authoring SVG assets"). SVG is text; most agents can write it.
- **Yes + the agent can create/insert the asset** (screenshots via capture, images via generation, uploads) → create or insert it, only when the user asked for visuals and the tools/permissions allow (see Part 2).
- **Yes + the agent cannot create/insert the asset** → insert a precise `VISUAL SUGGESTION` comment at the exact location (photographs, screenshots, GIFs, videos, complex illustrations).

## The critical rule

> If a visual would significantly improve the documentation, either add it when the agent genuinely has the capability to do so, or leave a precise, actionable suggestion exactly where the visual belongs. **Never fake the asset.**

Without screenshot capture, image generation, image upload, repository asset creation, or a browser tool, the agent must NOT:

- Pretend a screenshot exists
- Invent an image path or filename
- Create a fake Markdown image reference (`![X](./fake.png)`)
- Use a nonexistent URL
- Claim an image was added
- Insert broken image links

## Suggestion format

HTML comments render invisibly on GitHub and in most renderers. Place the suggestion **immediately after the content it illustrates** — never all at the bottom of the document.

```md
<!-- VISUAL SUGGESTION [TYPE]:
Add a screenshot of [specific subject] here.
Show [specific elements/details].
Purpose: [why this visual would help the reader].
-->
```

Type comes from this set: `SCREENSHOT`, `DIAGRAM`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `WORKFLOW`, `GIF`, `VIDEO`, `UI_PREVIEW`, `BEFORE_AFTER`, `CHART`, `ILLUSTRATION`, `LOGO`, `TECH_STACK`.

## Specificity requirements

A suggestion must answer four questions:

1. **What** should be shown?
2. **Where** should it be captured from?
3. **What details** should be visible?
4. **Why** is the visual useful?

Never write vague suggestions:

```md
<!-- VISUAL SUGGESTION:
Add a screenshot here.
-->
```

Always be specific:

```md
<!-- VISUAL SUGGESTION [SCREENSHOT]:
Add a screenshot of the login page here.
Show the email/password fields, the login button, and the "Forgot password" link.
Purpose: Give users a visual preview of the authentication interface.
-->
```

## Context-based inference

Infer the appropriate visual from the surrounding Markdown:

| Context | Suggested visual |
| --- | --- |
| UI documentation / dashboard / interface section | `SCREENSHOT` or `UI_PREVIEW` of that exact screen |
| Installation with a GUI installer | `SCREENSHOT` of the configuration screen, highlighting fields users must configure (not needed for plain CLI installs) |
| Architecture explanation | `ARCHITECTURE` diagram of the components and their relationships |
| Multi-step workflow or process | `WORKFLOW` diagram from input through processing to output |
| Before/after comparison, migration, refactor | `BEFORE_AFTER` images |
| Data, metrics, statistics | `CHART` or annotated `SCREENSHOT` |
| Complex CLI output hard to follow in text | `SCREENSHOT` or `GIF` of the terminal |
| Feature that is much clearer in motion | `GIF` or `VIDEO` |
| Project identity missing from the header | `LOGO` |
| Tech stack that would scan better visually | `TECH_STACK` icons (see Part 2) |

## High-value vs poor candidates

Suggest only high-value visuals:

- Good: complex UI, dashboards, application interfaces, architecture, workflows, complicated processes, before/after comparisons, feature demonstrations, visual configuration, data visualization, game or mobile interfaces, hard-to-follow CLI output.
- Poor: simple explanations, short paragraphs, basic installation commands, simple API definitions, trivial configuration, content already perfectly explained by text, every section of a README.

**Quality over quantity.** If a section is clear without a visual, leave it alone.

## Filename suggestions

A suggestion may include a recommended filename, but it must clearly indicate the file does not yet exist — never turn it into an image reference:

```md
<!-- VISUAL SUGGESTION [SCREENSHOT]:
Recommended file: `assets/screenshots/dashboard-overview.png`

Add a screenshot of the main dashboard here.
Show the sidebar, KPI cards, revenue chart, and recent transactions.
Purpose: Provide a visual overview of the application's primary interface.
-->
```

Do NOT create the Markdown image reference until the file actually exists.

## Accessibility in suggestions

When useful, suggest what the eventual alt text should communicate:

```md
<!-- VISUAL SUGGESTION [SCREENSHOT]:
Add a screenshot of the analytics dashboard here.

Suggested alt text:
"Analytics dashboard showing revenue statistics, sales trends, and recent transactions."

Show the KPI cards, chart, and recent transaction table.
Purpose: Help readers understand the dashboard layout.
-->
```

## Do not duplicate existing visuals

Before suggesting a visual, inspect the document and repository. If a section already contains a screenshot, diagram, image, GIF, or video that fulfills the need, do not recommend another. An existing image that clearly does not fulfill the requirement (wrong subject, broken, decorative only) may be flagged for replacement instead.

## Capability detection

Determine what the current agent can actually do:

- Can inspect repository files
- Can create Markdown
- Can **author SVG text files** — banners, simple logos, icons, simple diagrams (nearly always true: SVG is text)
- Can create image files (PNG/JPEG rendering)
- Can generate images
- Can capture screenshots
- Can access a browser
- Can upload images
- Can modify repository assets
- Can modify a GitHub repository

Do not assume capabilities. But do not under-assume either: writing an SVG file is file writing, and any agent that can write Markdown can author one.

## Authoring SVG assets

SVG is text — when the document is GitHub-targeted and a banner, logo, icon set, or simple diagram is **missing**, create a real SVG file instead of suggesting one. This is the preferred path; `VISUAL SUGGESTION` is for assets the agent genuinely cannot produce (photographs, screenshots, GIFs, videos, complex illustrations).

**Never replace or convert existing images.** If the document already has an image — screenshot, photo, logo, diagram, any format (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG) — keep it exactly as it is: do not swap it for an authored SVG, do not re-create it, do not "upgrade" it. SVG authoring applies only to assets that do not exist yet. An existing image that is broken or clearly wrong may be flagged for replacement in a `VISUAL SUGGESTION` comment — never silently replaced.

Rules:

- Save the asset in the repository (`assets/banner.svg`, `assets/logo.svg`, `assets/icons/<name>.svg`), verify it exists, then reference it. Never reference before the file is confirmed.
- **Banner**: `width="1200" height="300"`, matching `viewBox`, one tasteful gradient or solid color, white text, font stack (`Segoe UI, Arial, sans-serif`), `role="img"` and a descriptive `aria-label`. Render centered: `<p align="center"><img src="./assets/banner.svg" alt="..." width="100%"></p>`.
- **Logo**: simple — two colors max, `viewBox="0 0 512 512"`, geometric shapes.
- **Icons**: one per feature is overkill; a single restrained set (max 4–6) or none.
- **Simple diagrams** (flow, architecture): only when a Mermaid fence would not render (non-GitHub targets); prefer Mermaid on GitHub.
- No trademark mimicry: never imitate an existing brand's logo; never create a project identity the author did not ask for — if the project's identity is unknown, create a neutral banner or ask.
- Respect the decoration budget: one hero element (banner OR logo, not both).
- Keep the SVG hand-maintainable: small, readable, plain shapes — no embedded photos, no generated noise.

## Visual review report

Report the outcome to the user after the review:

```text
Visual Review: No additional visuals recommended.
```

or, when suggestions were added:

```text
Visual Review

3 visual opportunities identified:
1. Dashboard screenshot
2. Authentication flow diagram
3. Architecture diagram

The suggestions were inserted directly at the relevant locations in the Markdown.
```

Keep the report concise.

# Part 2: Adding real assets

## When visuals are appropriate

The priority ladder is correctness → structure → readability → accessibility → useful visuals → decoration. Visuals are never a substitute for good structure.

Add visuals when the document is GitHub-targeted and one of these applies:

- A tech stack worth scanning at a glance (icons)
- CI/build/version status worth showing (badges)
- A product that benefits from seeing it (screenshot/demo GIF)
- An architecture or flow worth diagramming
- An existing project identity (logo) that belongs in the header

Do **not** add everything automatically. Excessive decoration hurts readability and maintainability.

## Asset discovery first

Before introducing any external asset, inspect the repository for existing assets:

```text
assets/
docs/
docs/images/
images/
.github/
.github/assets/
```

and common files such as:

```text
logo.svg   logo.png   icon.svg   icon.png
```

Also check for theme variants (`logo-dark.svg`, `logo-light.svg`, `logo-dark-mode.svg`). Prefer existing project assets over external URLs. Do not replace an established visual identity without being asked.

## Adding screenshots

If the agent can capture a real interface and the user asked for screenshots:

1. Capture the relevant screenshot.
2. Save it with a descriptive kebab-case filename.
3. Place it in an appropriate repository asset directory (see "Asset organization").
4. Insert the correct Markdown image reference with meaningful alt text.
5. Verify the path — never reference a file before confirming it exists.

```md
![Application dashboard showing sales analytics](./assets/screenshots/dashboard.png)
```

## Technology icons

For a tech stack list like:

```md
## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
```

you may offer a visual stack row:

```html
<p align="left">
  <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/react/61DAFB" width="32" height="32" alt="React">
  <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/typescript/3178C6" width="32" height="32" alt="TypeScript">
  <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/node.js/5FA04E" width="32" height="32" alt="Node.js">
  <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/postgresql/4169E1" width="32" height="32" alt="PostgreSQL">
</p>
```

Rules:

- Only include technologies actually present in the project — never pad the stack.
- **Use Simple Icons**: `https://cdn.simpleicons.org/<slug>/<hex-color>` (see <https://simpleicons.org/>). Confirm each slug exists on simpleicons.org before using it; a slug you cannot confirm is omitted — never guessed.
- Other documented, verified URL patterns:
  - Devicon: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/<name>/<name>-original.svg` (see <https://devicon.dev/>)
  - Shields.io: `https://img.shields.io/badge/<LABEL>-<VALUE>-<COLOR>` (see <https://shields.io/>)
  - Official technology assets (e.g., `https://nodejs.org/static/images/logo.svg` — verify first)
- Every `<img>` needs `alt` text and a `width` (32 px with matching `height` for Simple Icons; 40–64 px is typical for stack rows).
- Verify URLs when possible (HTTP 200). If you cannot verify, say so instead of guessing.

## Badges

- Place badges in a compact row under the title (or on the hero line).
- Use static shields.io badges for common states: `https://img.shields.io/badge/<LABEL>-<VALUE>-<COLOR>`.
- Use dynamic badges (`https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/owner/repo`) only with the project's real owner/repo — never fabricate a repository identity.
- Keep badges meaningful: version, build, license, downloads. Three to six max.
- Badge text and values must be truthful. No "100% awesome" filler badges.

## Logos and theme-aware images

- When a logo exists in the repo (or in the tech's official assets), prefer it.
- For logos that differ between light/dark themes, GitHub supports:
  ```html
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./assets/logo-dark.svg">
    <img src="./assets/logo-light.svg" alt="Project logo">
  </picture>
  ```
- Relative paths keep theme-aware images working in forks and previews.
- Never fabricate a logo; if the project has none, leave the header text-only or suggest a `LOGO` visual.

## Diagrams

- Mermaid fences render on GitHub: `` ```mermaid `` — use for architecture and flow diagrams in GitHub-targeted documents.
- ASCII diagrams are the portable alternative for CommonMark-only documents.
- Diagrams must be legible in monospace; never compress an architecture diagram into a single unreadable line.
- If the agent cannot render a diagram, use a `DIAGRAM`/`ARCHITECTURE`/`WORKFLOW` suggestion instead of a broken image.

## Asset organization

When suggesting or creating assets, recommend a consistent directory structure that fits the repository:

```text
assets/
├── images/
├── screenshots/
├── diagrams/
└── icons/
```

or:

```text
docs/
└── images/
    ├── screenshots/
    ├── diagrams/
    └── architecture/
```

Choose the structure that best fits the repository. Do not create unnecessary directories for one image.

## Decoration budget

- One hero element (logo or hero image) — not both, not three.
- Tech icons OR a tech-stack list — converting an existing list is optional, not mandatory.
- Badges: a single row, meaningful only.
- Excessive visual decoration (multiple banners, animated dividers, emoji-heavy section headers) should be reduced, not emulated.

# Part 3: Verification checklist

- [ ] Every suggestion is placed immediately after the content it illustrates — never dumped at the bottom
- [ ] Every suggestion is specific (what / where / details / why) and typed (`SCREENSHOT`, `ARCHITECTURE`, …)
- [ ] Suggestions are high-value only; existing visuals are respected and never duplicated
- [ ] No fake image references, invented paths, or nonexistent URLs anywhere
- [ ] Authored SVG assets exist on disk before being referenced; banners have `role="img"` + `aria-label`, sane dimensions and viewBox
- [ ] Image references appear only for files that were verified to exist
- [ ] Every URL used is a real, documented pattern or a verified live URL
- [ ] Every technology in an icon row is actually in the project
- [ ] Every badge is truthful; no fabricated owner/repo
- [ ] Every real image has alt text and a sane width
- [ ] Theme-aware logos handled with `<picture>` and relative paths
- [ ] Asset directories are consistent with the repository layout
- [ ] Total decoration is within budget; the README is still readable
